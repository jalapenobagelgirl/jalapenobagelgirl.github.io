                <a href="https://www.danielspatzek.com/home/">Daniel Spatzek Portfolio</a>
                   <p>I chose this website as inspiration because it is so fun and crazy and whimiscal. Daniel Spatzek really had a fun time messing around with his portfolio. Also this animated banana is hilarious.</p>

                  <a href="https://babylone.fr/">Babylone Website</a>
                    <p>I am inspired by this website because I really enjoy the color pallete, moving static-like texture, and marquees. The condensed fonts are very nice and the constant movement throughout is pleasing. I also am inspired by the thin black strokes and wide fonts.</p>

                <a href="https://www.flyingpapers.com/">Flying Papers Website</a>
                  <p>I am inspired by this website because of the moving type. The stretching and squishing of the words is so fun and eye-catching. There are bright colors with white text. Also the animations are my favorite. </p>

    <h3>Project 1 Idea</h3>
      <h3 class="date">january 31, 2023</h3>
            <article>
                   <p>My project 1 idea is to create a website that displays my favorite genres of music. Within the genres, my website will feature my favorite artists and favorite songs by them. 
                   Aesthetically, I plan to make a vibrant, bold, sans-serif, modern style. 
                   </p>

    <h3>Websites I would Redo</h3>
      <h3 class="date">february 20, 2023</h3>
<main class="parent two-cols">
        <article class="left">
            <p>Two websites I would redo are <a href="#">The Alibi</a> and <a href="#">Posies Cafe and Bakery.</a> I chose these websites because these are places I go frequently and really enjoy. I think their websites are not serving the best purposes they could.<p>
        <p>The Alibi is a very oldschool tiki bar that has karaoke and cheesy decorations. Right now their website is pretty bad.</p>
