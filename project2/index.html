        <h1 class="about-title">OUR STORY</h1>
       
            <p>The original home of The ALIBI was a nice stop for horses and buggies as they traveled up and down the dirt trail known as the Inter-state in the late 1800's. "Chat-n-nibble", as it was known to travelers then served up some of the finest grub a fellow could find at a breakfast and lunch counter. A small beginning! The next business to call the spot home was a tiny tavern run by Mr. Peterson, "Max Alibi" was a popular place to stop, and saw much success under his ownership. Peterson gave the business a name that would last far into the 1990's. The third owner Roy Ell saw a jewel of a restaurant in this little stop. He leased the building in 1947 and renamed the place "The ALIBI."

            In 1992, the current owner, Larry White, took over and has agreed to keep the style and flourish what has been so magnificent for some 50 years. As you sit in The ALIBI Lounge, Restaurant or one of the many nooks and shelters, under shell lamp shades in bamboo cane chairs, you can almost feel the cool summer breeze blow across the beach. Sipping tantalizing tropical drinks, letting the atmosphere sink in, nibbling on seafood appetizers and entrees, it's so easy to relax and enjoy a mini vacation in the midst of your day. </p>
